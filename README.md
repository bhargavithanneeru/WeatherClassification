## Overview

This project is a Weather Classification System that uses images to classify weather conditions into different categories. It includes image data processing, data augmentation, model training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Other required libraries (specified in the code)



### Data

The image data for this project is stored in the 'dataset' directory. Make sure to organize your data in this format before running the code.

## Data Preprocessing

- Data distribution analysis is performed to understand class distribution.
- Data augmentation techniques are applied to balance the dataset.

## Model Training

This project utilizes several pre-trained deep learning models for image classification, including ResNet152V2, VGG16, CNN, and Xception.

### ResNet152V2

- A ResNet152V2 model is used for classification.
- Model training details are available in the code.

### VGG16

- A VGG16 model is employed for image classification.
- Model training and evaluation details are available in the code.

### CNN

- A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for image classification.
- The model training process and evaluation are described in the code.

### Xception

- An Xception model is used for image classification.
- Details of model training and evaluation are available in the code.

## Data Visualization

- The project includes various data visualization techniques to analyze the results of model training.

## Evaluation

- The trained models are evaluated on a test dataset.
